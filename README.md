# TicTacToe
Personal code on a Tic Tac Toe game, with emphasis on robustness.

With help of some Youtube Tutorial videos, developed my own take on the classic game Tic Tac Toe.

Some of the tutorials online lacked robustness as most only focused on helping beginners start with coding the game, so I paid more attention to this aspect when writing this script.

Uses terminal display, check out my other Tic Tac Toe script incorporated with the Pygame module for a more interactive experience.
