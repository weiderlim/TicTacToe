# TicTacToe
Personal code on the classic Tic Tac Toe game, with emphasis on code robustness.

The tictactoe_pygame.py file requires the pygame module to be installed first. It is a more interactive version with many more features compared to the tictactoe_basic.py file. It includes keeping player scores, handles game restart with user keyboard input, and enables user mouse input to enter position of X's and O's.

The tictactoe_basic.py file does not require any preinstalled modules. It runs fine with terminal or cmd commands, and uses terminal display.

Some of the tutorials online lacked robustness as most only focused on helping beginners start with coding the game, so I paid more attention to this aspect when writing this script.

Enjoy!
